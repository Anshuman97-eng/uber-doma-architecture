## 💡 Why DOMA? Architecture Evolution: Flat Mesh vs. DOMA

</p>

### The Evolution: From Monolith to Microservices to DOMA

As Uber scaled from a city-by-city ride-hailing app into a planetary mobility platform handling tens of millions of concurrent trips, its software architecture underwent three massive evolutionary phases:

1. **The Monolith Era (2010–2014):** A single monolithic Python/Ruby codebase (`dispatch-monolith`). While simple initially, it caused massive deployment lock contention, tight relational database coupling, and single-point-of-failure outages.
2. **The Microservice Boom (2014–2018):** Uber decomposed the monolith into thousands of microservices across hundreds of engineering teams. However, without strict domain boundaries, it created an unconstrained **Traditional Flat Mesh**—a chaotic "death star" architecture where any service could call any other service.
3. **The DOMA Era (2018–Present):** To tame the crisis of microservice sprawl, Uber invented **Domain-Oriented Microservice Architecture (DOMA)**. DOMA introduces structured bounded domains, two-tier gateway encapsulation, and agnostic downward dependency rules to restore order, predictability, and high engineering velocity.

### The 5 Critical Failures of a Traditional Flat Mesh

| Failure Mode | Traditional Flat Mesh Problem | How DOMA Solves It |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **$O(N^2)$ Complexity Explosion** | In a flat mesh of $N$ services, potential connections scale to $N(N-1)$. 40 services yield over **1,500 point-to-point connections**, making system visualization and dependency tracing impossible. | Clusters 40 microservices into **6 Bounded Domains**. The Edge Gateway and external callers interact **only with Tier 2 Domain Gateways**, reducing global connection complexity from $O(N^2)$ to $O(D)$. |
| **Unbounded Blast Radius** | A memory leak, deadlock, or slow query in a non-critical leaf service (e.g. `promo-rider-discount-service` or `lost-and-found-service`) cascades upstream and takes down the core trip booking flow. | **Encapsulation & Bulkheading:** Domain Gateways isolate internal leaf failures with Resilience4j circuit breakers, timeouts, and deterministic fallbacks. Core trip matching remains immune to auxiliary outages. |
| **Spaghetti & Circular Dependencies** | Service A invokes Service B, which queries Service C, which asynchronously emits an event consumed by Service A. This leads to distributed deadlocks and unresolvable deployment order dependencies. | **Agnostic Downward Dependency Rules:** Invocations flow strictly downwards (Edge $\to$ Gateway $\to$ Domain Core $\to$ Infrastructure). Circular calls and upward invocations are strictly forbidden and verified at compile-time via ArchUnit. |
| **Cognitive Overload & On-Call Chaos** | On-call engineers paged at 2 AM for a p99 latency spike must trace execution paths across 30 disjointed services owned by 12 different teams with fragmented ownership. | **Clear Domain Ownership (Conway's Law):** Each domain has a dedicated platform team managing its Domain Gateway, Protobuf contracts, and SLA guarantees. Teams deploy internal leaf services autonomously. |
| **Database Coupling & Shared State** | Microservices query each other's databases directly or bypass domain logic via shared tables, leaking internal schema details and preventing database optimizations. | **Strict Persistence Isolation:** Zero cross-service or cross-domain database queries. Every microservice owns its private PostgreSQL schema, accessed exclusively via gRPC IPC or Kafka event streams. |

### The 4 Core Pillars of DOMA

1. **Domains as Bounded Contexts:**  
   Related microservices are grouped into collections representing logical business boundaries (e.g., **Mobility**, **Trip Lifecycle**, **Billing & Fares**, **Driver Asset**, **Rider Identity**, **Core Platform**).
2. **Layered Two-Tier Gateway Encapsulation:**  
   The **Tier 1 Edge Gateway** handles perimeter concerns (TLS, OAuth2, WAF, global rate limits). The **Tier 2 Domain Gateways** act as the sole entry point for each domain, transcoding external HTTP/REST requests into optimized binary gRPC stubs. Internal leaf microservices and databases are private and completely inaccessible from outside the domain.
3. **Extension Architecture:**  
   Core domains provide extension points so auxiliary features (rider discounts, seasonal promos, airport surcharges) hook cleanly into core lifecycles without modifying critical dispatch code.
4. **Compile-Time & Network-Level Boundary Enforcement:**  
   Boundary rules are not mere suggestions—they are enforced at **compile-time** using ArchUnit tests and at **runtime** using Kubernetes Network Policies and Istio AuthorizationPolicies. Direct cross-domain leaf calls result in build failures.

## 🗺️ Tiered Traffic Routing & Interservice Communication

The core request routing model across the **Edge Gateway (Tier 1)**, **Domain Gateways (Tier 2)**, and internal **Ride-Sharing Microservices**, illustrating:
1. **Intra-Domain gRPC IPC (Green Vectors):** Microservices inside the same bounded domain invoke each other directly via low-latency internal gRPC stubs.
2. **Blocked Cross-Domain Calls (Red Vector):** Services can **never** directly invoke microservices residing in a different domain—all cross-domain collaboration is forced through Tier 2 Sub-Gateways.

## 🔀 Inter-Gateway & Same-Domain Interservice Communication

A major challenge in distributed architectures is understanding **how services communicate inside vs. across domain boundaries**. DOMA provides strict architectural rules:

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/inter-gateway-and-service-communication.svg" alt="Inter-Gateway & Same-Domain Interservice Communication Rules" width="100%">
</p>

### 1. Same-Domain Interservice Communication (Inside the Bounded Context)
Microservices residing inside the **same domain** collaborate through two well-defined patterns:
* **Synchronous Low-Latency gRPC IPC (Green Vectors):**
  - Services within the same domain share domain-internal Protobuf contracts.
  - *Example:* When `Driver Match (DISCO)` identifies a candidate, it directly calls `Route Planner (Gurafu)` via internal gRPC (`computeRoute()`) to calculate the detour distance. This is 100% legal because both belong to the **Mobility Domain**.
* **Asynchronous Domain Event Streaming (Kafka Broker):**
  - When state changes, services emit domain events via the **Transactional Outbox Pattern** to local Kafka topics.
  - *Example:* `Supply Locator` publishes `DriverAvailableEvent`, which is asynchronously consumed by the `DISCO Matcher` without tight coupling.

### 2. Inter-Sub Gateway Communication (Tier-2 to Tier-2 Cross-Domain)
* **Allowed:** When a service in the `Trip Domain` requires billing data, it **never** calls `Payment Core` directly.
* Instead, the `Trip Domain Gateway` invokes the `Billing Domain Gateway` over versioned, backward-compatible **gRPC / Protocol Buffer** contracts.
* **Benefit:** Each domain team refactors and deploys its internal leaf microservices independently without breaking other domains.

### 3. Prohibited: Cross-Domain Direct Leaf Calls (Red Vectors)
* Direct cross-domain leaf calls (e.g. `Driver Match` $\to$ `Payment Core`) are **strictly forbidden**.
* Enforced at compile-time via **ArchUnit architectural verification tests** and at runtime via **Kubernetes Network Policies / Istio AuthorizationPolicies**.

## 🔄 Two-Tier Request Lifecycle & Protocol Transcoding

How external client traffic is authenticated at the perimeter, routed, and transcoded into internal high-performance binary gRPC stubs:

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/two-tier-gateway-flow.svg" alt="Two-Tier Gateway Request Lifecycle" width="100%">
</p>

* **Tier 1 — Global Edge Gateway (`:8080`):** Edge TLS termination, OAuth2 JWT token verification, global rate limiting, and route mapping.
* **Tier 2 — Domain Gateways (`:8081 - :8085`):** Transcodes inbound HTTP/REST into internal gRPC stubs, fans out parallel scatter-gather queries, and applies circuit breakers.
* **Leaf Microservices (`:9001 - :9040`):** Pure bounded business logic executed over multiplexed HTTP/2 connections with zero cross-database queries.

        return Mono.zip(dispatchMono, surgeMono, etaMono)
